# Node_IRC_Client

This is intended to be a simple IRC client for embedding into
web pages, Iframes, and the like.  The usual installation
applies:

    npm install


Then edit the config file and start the client with:  ./client

Navigate to the appropriate IP/port with a browser and the
interface should pop up and work.

It works passably right now, and allows you to enter your
nickname, but doesn't give a "Connected" message yet.
